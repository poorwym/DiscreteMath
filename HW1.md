### 44
44.If $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ are $n$ propositions, explain why
\[
\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n-1} \bigwedge_{j=i+1}^{n} (\neg p_i \vee \neg p_j)
\]
is true if and only if at most one of $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ is true.

### answer
Pf:
case 1: for any $p_i$, $p_i$ is false,
then $\neg p_i$ is true,
then $\neg p_i \vee \neg p_j$ is true for any $j \neq i$,
then $\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n-1} \bigwedge_{j=i+1}^{n} (\neg p_i \vee \neg p_j)$ is true.

case 2: assume that $p_{i_0}$ is true, for all $i \neq i_0$, $p_i$ is false.
then $\neg p_{i_0}$ is false, for all $i \neq i_0$, $\neg p_i$ is true.
then for any pair of $p_i$ and $p_j$, $i \neq j$, $\neg p_i \vee \neg p_j$ is true.
then $\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n-1} \bigwedge_{j=i+1}^{n} (\neg p_i \vee \neg p_j)$ is true.

case 3: assume that more than one of $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ is true, say $p_{i_0}$ and $p_{i_1}$ are true.
then $\neg p_{i_0}$ is false, $\neg p_{i_1}$ is false,
then $\neg p_{i_0} \vee \neg p_{i_1}$ is false,
then $\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n-1} \bigwedge_{j=i+1}^{n} (\neg p_i \vee \neg p_j)$ is false.

Done
