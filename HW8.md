### 55

∗ 55. Describe an algorithm that finds the Cantor expansion of an integer.

---

### 64

## 4.3Exercise
### 13

∗ 13. Prove or disprove that there are three consecutive odd positive integers that are primes, that is, odd primes of the form $p$, $p + 2$, and $p + 4$.

---

### 21

The value of the Euler $\phi$-function at the positive integer $n$ is defined to be the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. For instance, $\phi(6) = 2$ because of the positive integers less or equal to 6, only 1 and 5 are relatively prime to 6. [Note: $\phi$ is the Greek letter phi.]  21. Find these values of the Euler $\phi$-function. a) $\phi(4)$ b) $\phi(10)$ c) $\phi(13)$

### 57

∗ 57. Prove that the set of positive rational numbers is countable by showing that the function $K$ is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of positive rational numbers and the set of positive integers if 
$K(m/n) = p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_s^{2a_s} q_1^{2b_1-1} q_2^{2b_2-1} \cdot \ldots \cdot q_t^{2b_t-1}$, 
where $\gcd(m, n) = 1$ and the prime-power factorizations of $m$ and $n$ are 
$m = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_s^{a_s}$ and $n = q_1^{b_1} q_2^{b_2} \cdots q_t^{b_t}$.
